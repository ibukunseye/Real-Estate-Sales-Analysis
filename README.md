Real Estate Data Analysis Project Description This project aims to explore property assessment and sales data to support informed decision-making in the real estate domain. The dataset used for analysis encompasses various attributes, including assessed value, sale amount, sales ratio, property type, and more, providing a comprehensive view of the real estate landscape.
Objectives Assessment Accuracy: Evaluate the accuracy of property assessments by comparing assessed values with actual sale amounts and identifying any discrepancies.
Market Trends: Analyze sales ratios to uncover trends in property market values, understanding how sale amounts relate to assessed values across different property types and residential classifications.
Geographical Analysis: Investigate variations in assessed values, sales amounts, and market ratios across different towns, providing a localized understanding of real estate dynamics.
Property Type Impact: Examine the impact of property type on assessment accuracy and market trends, exploring whether certain types (e.g., residential, commercial) exhibit distinct patterns.
Non-Use Code Insights: Explore the significance of non-use codes in property assessment, investigating how these codes influence assessed values and sales transactions.
Assessor and OPM Remarks: Analyze remarks provided by assessors and the Office of Policy and Management (OPM) to identify factors influencing assessment decisions and potential areas for improvement.
Steps Taken Data Exploration: The project started with a thorough exploration of the dataset, understanding its structure, and identifying key variables for analysis.
Data Cleaning: The dataset underwent a cleaning process to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure consistency in data format.
Assessment Accuracy Analysis: A comparative analysis was conducted to assess the accuracy of property assessments, highlighting any disparities between assessed values and actual sale amounts.
Market Trends Analysis: Sales ratios were analyzed to identify trends in property market values, providing insights into how different property types contribute to these trends.
Geographical Analysis: Town-wise variations in assessed values, sales amounts, and market ratios were examined to offer localized perspectives on real estate dynamics.
Property Type Impact: The impact of property type on assessment accuracy and market trends was explored, revealing potential patterns and differences.
Non-Use Code Insights: The significance of non-use codes in property assessment was investigated to understand their influence on assessed values and sales transactions.
Assessor and OPM Remarks Analysis: Remarks provided by assessors and the Office of Policy and Management were analyzed to identify factors influencing assessment decisions.
Challenges Faced Data Quality: Ensuring data quality posed challenges, including handling missing values and addressing inconsistencies in the dataset.
Complex Analysis: Conducting in-depth analyses, especially regarding geographical variations and non-use code impact, required advanced techniques and tools.
Interpreting Remarks: Analyzing and interpreting remarks provided challenges due to the subjective nature of the data.
Visualization: Creating meaningful visualizations for complex analyses required careful consideration of the audience and their understanding of real estate metrics.
Future Work The project lays the foundation for continued exploration, and future work may involve more sophisticated modeling, collaboration with domain experts, and integrating additional datasets for a comprehensive understanding of real estate dynamics.
